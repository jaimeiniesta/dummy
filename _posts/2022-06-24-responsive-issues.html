<style type="text/css">
  .mobile_only {
    display: none;
  }

  .low_contrast_text {
    background-color: #ddd;
    color: #fff;
  }

  @media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
    .mobile_only {
      display: inline
    }
  }
</style>

<p>
  This paragraph will always be displayed in all widths, but the next paragraph will only appear when the device is up to 480px wide.
</p>

<p class="mobile_only">
  This paragraph will only appear on narrow screens, and it contains an accessibility error because <span class="low_contrast_text">some text is hard to read as it has low contrast</span>.
</p>
